HISTORY
</h1><h4 align="centre"></h4>Archaeological evidences suggest that the Andhra region was a part of the Mauryan Empire. The Satavahana dynasty dominated the Deccan 
region from the 1st century BCE to the 3rd century CE. The later Satavahanas made Dharanikota and Amaravathi their capital, which according to the Buddhists is the 
place where Nagarjuna, the philosopher of Mahayana lived in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. The Andhra Ikshvakus, with their capital at Vijayapuri, succeeded the Satavahanas
in the Krishna River valley in the latter half of the 2nd century. Pallavas, who were originally executive officers under the Satavahana kings, were not a 
recognised political power before the 2nd century CE and were swept away by the Western Chalukyan invasion, led by Pulakesin II in the first quarter of the 7th century 
CE.After the downfall of the Ikshvakus, the Vishnukundinas were the first great dynasty in the 5th and 6th centuries, and held sway over the entire Andhra country, 
including Kalinga and parts of Telangana. They played an important role in the history of Deccan during the 5th and 6th century CE, with Eluru, Amaravathi and 
Puranisangam. Harihara and Bukka, who served as treasury officers of the Kakatiyas of Warangal, founded the Vijayanagara Empire.In 1347 CE, an independent Muslim state,
the Bahmani Sultanate, was established in south India by Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah in a revolt against the Delhi Sultanate. The Qutb Shahi dynasty held sway over the 
Andhra country after the resolution of Vijayanagar empire by joint action of Mughals, Bijapur and Golconda sultanates. In the early nineteenth century, Northern Circars
was ceded to the British East India Company and became part of the Madras Presidency. Eventually, this region emerged as the Coastal Andhra region. Later the Nizam 
rulers of Hyderabad ceded five territories to the British that eventually became the Rayalaseema region. The Nizams retained control of the interior provinces as the 
princely state of Hyderabad, acknowledging British rule in return for local autonomy. However, Komaram Bheem, a tribal leader, started his fight against the erstwhile 
Asaf Jahi Dynasty for the liberation of Hyderabad State.Meanwhile, the French occupied Yanam, in the Godavari delta, and (save for periods of British control) would 
hold it until 1954. In 1947, Vizianagaram was the largest Hindu princely state in Andhra Pradesh. In 1839 just before the British Raj, a cyclone struck Coringa, East 
Godavari district and toppled buildings, as a result 20,000 ships were destroyed and over 300,000 people were killed. India became independent from the British Raj in 
1947. The Nizam wanted to retain the independence of the Princely Hyderabad State from India, but the people of the region launched a movement to join the Indian Union.
The state of Hyderabad was integrated into the Indian Union with Operation Polo in 1948.<br>

CLIMATE
</h1><h4 align="centre">The climate of Andhra Pradesh varies considerably, depending on the geographical region. Summers last from March to June. In the coastal plain,
the summer temperatures are generally higher than the rest of the state, with temperature ranging between 20 and 41 °C (68 and 106 °F). July to September is the season
for tropical rains. About one-third of the total rainfall is brought by the northeast monsoon. October and November see low-pressure systems and tropical cyclones form
in the Bay of Bengal which, along with the northeast monsoon, bring rains to the southern and coastal regions of the state. November, December, January, and February 
are the winter months in Andhra Pradesh. Since the state has a long coastal belt the winters are not very cold. The range of winter temperature is generally 12 to 30 °C
(54 to 86 °F). Lambasingi in Visakhapatnam district is also nicknamed as the "Kashmir of Andhra Pradesh" due to its relatively cool climate as compared to others and 
the temperature ranges from 0 to 10 °C (32 to 50 °F).</h4>
